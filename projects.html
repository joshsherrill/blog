<h3 class="project-title">Image Essence</h3>
<span class="project-link"><a href="#">imgessence.com</a> / April 2013</span>
<p class="project-description">
    Image Essence was a project I made to play around with the Bing API. It allowed users to enter a query and would return an average of the first 50 images returned by Bing. This created an abstract "essence" of the search term which led to some fun results. 
    I unfortunately did not archive it very well and it is no longer available. It was built using Laravel 3, Bootstrap CSS, Bing API and the ImageMagick library for the blending.
